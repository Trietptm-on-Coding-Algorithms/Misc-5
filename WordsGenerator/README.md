# Words generator

This simple code creates all possible words given as input an alphabet of arbitrary length (it can be used to generate all passwords given a set of characters). 
For example given "AB" as alphabet it generates:

A
B
AA
AB
BA
BB

If you wonder why I created such project, it is just becasue I was bored and the implementation can be tricky to do :) I provide two types of implementation, the first one use a recursive algorithm and the second one use an iterative one.
