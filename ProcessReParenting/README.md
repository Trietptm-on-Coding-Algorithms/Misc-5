# Process Re-Parenting
This simple code creates a new process and re-parent it to explorer.exe. It is useful to simulate the creation of a process from some other remote process (Explorer in this case).

Even if it is nothing new I saw a lot of code doing very dirty things in order to achieve this (like creating a remote thread or stuff like that).
